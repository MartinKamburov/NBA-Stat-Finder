React Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from within functional components. Some React hooks are:
    - useState: Enables functional components to manage state
    - useEffect: Handles side effects like data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions, acting as a combination of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount
    - useContext: Allows functional components to access context values, simplifying the process of sharing data between components without prop drilling

        - useCallback
        - useRef
